DXARTS 200
Author: Michelle Ngo 

This project invites viewers to explore the facets of my personal identity through the letters of my name, "Michelle." Each letter represents a core value, aspiration, or memory that significantly shapes who I am. The concept is a creative exploration of self, emphasizing not only my individuality but also my cultural heritage as a Vietnamese-American.
